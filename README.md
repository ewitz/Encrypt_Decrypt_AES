# Encrypt_Decrypt_AES
This is a web app/service that can both encrypt and decrypt your plainText or cipherText, respectively.  This service was created so that I would not be forced to use and pay for Microsoft's "Azure Key Vault."

Using this service correctly will allow your organization to be FIPS 140-2 compliant - required for all federal and some state organizations.  Links giving further clarification on FIPS 140-2 can be found within this app.

Instructions on how to configure your dot net core apps/services to utilize this encrypt/decrypt service will be provided shortly...
